--------------

Version 1.03 - Mon Jun 22 20:34:08 UTC 2009

Attempt to recover from people calling UNIVERSAL::isa as a function

    # from the shell
    echo 'export PERL5OPT=-MUNIVERSAL::isa' >> /etc/profile

    # within your program
    use UNIVERSAL::isa;

    # verbose reporting
    use UNIVERSAL::isa 'verbose';

INSTALLATION

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ perl ./Build
    $ perl ./Build test
    $ sudo perl ./Build install

APOLOGIA

    Whenever you use "isa" in UNIVERSAL as a function, a kitten using
Test::MockObject dies. Normally, the kittens would be helpless, but if they use
UNIVERSAL::isa (the module whose docs you are reading), the kittens can live
long and prosper.

    This module replaces "UNIVERSAL::isa" with a version that makes sure that,
when called as a function on objects which override "isa", "isa" will call the
appropriate method on those objects

    In all other cases, the real "UNIVERSAL::isa" gets called directly.
