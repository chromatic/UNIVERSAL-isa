UNIVERSAL::isa
--------------

Version 0.06 - Fri Feb 24 06:57:52 UTC 2006

Attempt to recover from people calling UNIVERSAL::isa as a function

	# from the shell
	echo 'export PERL5OPT=-MUNIVERSAL::isa' >> /etc/profile

	# within your program
	use UNIVERSAL::isa;

INSTALLATION

	$ perl Build.PL
	$ perl ./Build
	$ perl ./Build test
	$ sudo perl ./Build install

APOLOGIA

	Whenever you use "isa" in UNIVERSAL as a function, a kitten using
Test::MockObject dies. Normally, the kittens would be helpless, but if they use
UNIVERSAL::isa (the module whose docs you are reading), the kittens can live
long and prosper.

	This module replaces "UNIVERSAL::isa" with a version that makes sure that,
when called as a function on objects which override "isa", "isa" will call the
appropriate method on those objects

    In all other cases, the real "UNIVERSAL::isa" gets called directly.
